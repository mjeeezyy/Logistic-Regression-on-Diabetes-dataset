# Logistic_Regression_on_Diabetes_Dataset
I built a Machine Learning model to accurately predict if a patient has diabetes or not based on the variables in the dataset.
I used a Logistic Regression classifier model. The dataset is from Kaggle, via the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive 
and Kidney Diseases. The patients in the dataset comprises of females who are at least 21 years old and are indegenes of the 
Pima tribe in India.
